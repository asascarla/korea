<h3>SOUTH KOREAN CULTURE & TRADITIONS</h3>

          <center><img src="C:\Users\panga_000\Downloads\jan.jpg"</center> 
<p> 
•Korea is greatly influenced by the Chinese and Japanese cultures. This influence can be seen by Confucianism, which established many traditions that can be seen in modern Korea today. These traditions include the ethical code of conduct in social life and showing respect to the elders and family.
Koreans also believe in sincerity and loyalty and follow certain codes of conduct while meeting, eating, praying and even celebrating. At times when many other cultures would shake hands, Koreans bow. They bow as a sign of gratitude and respect to the person they are meeting.

•The traditional dress known as hanbok. The hanbok consists of a shirt (jeogori) and a skirt (chima).
Hanbok are classified according to their purposes: everyday dress, ceremonial dress and special dress. Ceremonial dresses are worn on formal occasions, including a child's first birthday (doljanchi), a wedding or a funeral.
Traditionally, the hanbok was a wedding dress that dates back to the 14th century. It was a floor-length gown with an empire waist, fitted jacket, and sewn with vibrant or pastel colors. The use of the Hanbok in daily wear has dropped significantly over the last handful of decades.

A traditional Korean home is called hanok. The main feature of a hanok is that it has combination of ondol, the Korean under-floor heating system, and wooden floor for heating and cooling. This style is mainly used in Korea because of problems caused by the area having both a continental climate and an oceanic climate.

•The symbol of the dragon has been used extensively in Korean culture, both in Korean mythology and ancient Korean art. The Korean dragon is in many ways very similar in appearance to other East Asian dragons such as the Chinese and Japanese dragons. It differs from the Chinese dragon in that it developed a longer beard. Korean dragons are omnipotent beings that embody rich and positive symbolism such as wisdom, serenity, and justice.

<h3>KOREAN PEOPLE</h3>
 
            <center><img src="C:\Users\panga_000\Downloads\ja.jpg"</center>
<p>
-Parents work very hard to provide the very best education possible for their children. One reason for this is because parents usually rely on their children for support after retirement. In Korea, traditional gender roles are socialized into the children starting at an early age. Therefore, the parents feel that it is more important to see that their sons get the best education before their daughters. The parents usually have sons depend on them more while going through the teenage years and sometimes even after he is married. In the Korean society, these gender differences usually allow the women to be more of a free spirit than the men

<h5>THREE KINGDOMS AND OTHER STATES</h5>
<p>

-Towards the end of the Gojoseon Period, tribal states came into being one after another in Manchuria and on the Korean Peninsula. Buyeo was established in the plains along the Songhua River in Manchuria and Jilin. The people of Buyeo grew crops and raised livestock, including horses. They also made furs. By the early 1st century CE, they started calling their main leader the King and actively engaged with other countries, even entering into diplomatic relations with China. By the end of the 3rd century, Buyeo had been incorporated into Goguryeo. The people of Buyeo held an annual festival called Yeonggo in December. During the festival, they held a sacrificial rite for heaven, sang and danced together, and released prisoners.

<h5>NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN STATES PERIOD: UNIFIED SILLA AND BALHAE</h5>
<p>
-Balhae started expanding its territory and regained control over most of the former territory of Goguryeo. During the reign of King Mu, Balhae controlled the northern parts of Manchuria. King Mun reformed the system of governance and moved the capital to Sanggyeong (present-day Ningan-xian, Heilongjiang province) in about 755. The people of Balhae took pride in their Goguryeo inheritance. Letters held in Japan show that the kings of Balhae referred to themselves as the Kings of Goguryeo. Balhae eventually grew so large and strong that the people of Tang China called it Haedong Seongguk (“prosperous country in the east”), but it fell in 926 as a result of an eruption of Baekdusan Mountain and an invasion of the Khitan people.
